# Environment-sensing
this repository contains all the code and hardware designs for a environemntal sensing divice that measures environmental paramaters ike: illuminance, VOC's, Co2, 10 channel collour, sound, humdidity, temperature and atmospheric pressure and can employ tinyML to classify some data.

# Pre requisites 
# Hardware
- arduino nano 33 ble sense
- esp32 (devkit)
# Software 
- edge impulse cli
- esp idf/arduino ide/visual studio code
- git bash
- nrf connect (Android or IOS)

# Use esp to capture datapoints for edge impulse
first upload the ...data_aquisition code for example (AS7341_data_aquisition) this code can be editted for your specific sensor
then open a commandprompt with edge impulse cli installed and type in the following command.
```
edge-impulse-data-fowarder
```
then the cli will ask you to login to your edge impulse account.
next the cli will ask to wich project you want to connect the device, this can be done by using the arrowkeys.
after this the cli will detect the ammount of sensor axis form the code and asks you to name them sperated by a, 
(this has to be done in the exact same order as in the code).
